The first stage after receiving data I started cleaning process
The dataset includes ~246,000 rows and 17 columns with categorical, numerical, and geolocation data.
Checked for duplicates using VIN — none found.
- `Vehicle Location` was cleaned and split into `Latitude` and `Longitude` for mapping.
- Missing values were handled:
- Columns with 4–17 blanks (`County`, `City`, `Base MSRP`, etc.) — rows removed.
- `Legislative District` (540 blanks) — filled with `"Unknown"`.
- `Base MSRP` was removed due to 98% of values being 0 — too incomplete for analysis.

This cleaning ensured data consistency and quality for further analysis in SQL and Tableau.
